# ðŸš€ What It Does
- Automatically scans all Excel files in the data/ folder.
- Each file is processed in a separate thread, allowing all files to be handled concurrently.
- Extracted data is stored in a dataclass dictionary.
- Once all threads are complete:
  - The program organizes the data by year and month.
  - Final results are saved to an Excel file in the reports/ folder.
